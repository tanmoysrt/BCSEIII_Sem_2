Consider a C like language with 

Data type : integer(iint) and char(char). A string is implemented as array of characters(string) and is a user defined data type.

input, output statement in the form of get x and put x
conditional statement of the form id = expression ? expression : expression is supported
Relational operators supported are < , > , =
Arithmetic operators supported are + , - , * 
Assignment operator = is supported

Only function is main(), it can contain arguments and can have return statement


write a good cfg and explains it
Here is a CFG (Context-Free Grammar) for the language:

php
Copy code
<program> -> <statement>
<statement> -> <input> | <output> | <assignment> | <conditional>
<input> -> get <identifier>
<output> -> put <identifier>
<assignment> -> <identifier> = <expression>
<conditional> -> <identifier> = <expression> ? <expression> : <expression>
<expression> -> <term> | <expression> + <term> | <expression> - <term>
<term> -> <factor> | <term> * <factor>
<factor> -> <identifier> | <constant> | (<expression>)
<identifier> -> <char> | <string> | <iint>
<constant> -> <integer>
Explanation:

The start symbol is <program>, which can be expanded to a single <statement>.
A <statement> can be an <input> statement, an <output> statement, an <assignment> statement, or a <conditional> statement.
An <input> statement starts with the keyword "get", followed by an <identifier> (a variable name).
An <output> statement starts with the keyword "put", followed by an <identifier> (a variable name).
An <assignment> statement consists of an <identifier> on the left-hand side of the "=" symbol, followed by an <expression> on the right-hand side.
A <conditional> statement consists of an <identifier> on the left-hand side of the "=", followed by three <expression>s separated by "?" and ":" symbols.
An <expression> can be a single <term>, or it can be a combination of two <expression>s connected by a "+" or "-" operator and another <term>.
A <term> can be a single <factor>, or it can be a combination of two <term>s connected by a "*" operator and another <factor>.
A <factor> can be an <identifier>, a <constant>, or an <expression> enclosed in parentheses.
An <identifier> can be a single character, a string, or an integer variable name.
A <constant> is an integer value.
This CFG specifies the valid syntax of the language. It can be used to generate a parse tree for a given program, which can then be used for syntax analysis and code generation.

how to generate the parse tree
To generate a parse tree for a given program in this language, you can use a parser that implements the grammar specified by the CFG.

One approach is to use a top-down parser, such as a recursive descent parser. This type of parser starts at the top of the grammar (the start symbol <program>) and recursively expands non-terminals in the grammar based on the input tokens until it reaches a terminal or a syntax error.

Here is an example of how you could implement a recursive descent parser in Python:

python
Copy code
# Define a list of tokens (e.g., generated by a lexer)
tokens = ['iint', 'x', '=', '5', '+', '2', '*', '3']

# Define a function for each non-terminal in the grammar
def program():
    return statement()

def statement():
    token = tokens[0]
    if token == 'get':
        return input_stmt()
    elif token == 'put':
        return output_stmt()
    elif token in ['iint', 'char', 'string']:
        return assignment_stmt()
    elif token in ['x', 'y', 'z']:
        return conditional_stmt()
    else:
        raise SyntaxError(f"Unexpected token: {token}")

def input_stmt():
    consume('get')
    identifier = consume('identifier')
    return InputStmt(identifier)

def output_stmt():
    consume('put')
    identifier = consume('identifier')
    return OutputStmt(identifier)

def assignment_stmt():
    identifier = consume('identifier')
    consume('=')
    expression = parse_expression()
    return AssignmentStmt(identifier, expression)

def conditional_stmt():
    identifier = consume('identifier')
    consume('=')
    expression1 = parse_expression()
    consume('?')
    expression2 = parse_expression()
    consume(':')
    expression3 = parse_expression()
    return ConditionalStmt(identifier, expression1, expression2, expression3)

def parse_expression():
    # TODO: Implement the expression parsing logic
    pass

def consume(expected_token_type):
    token = tokens.pop(0)
    if token.type == expected_token_type:
        return token.value
    else:
        raise SyntaxError(f"Expected {expected_token_type}, got {token.type}")

# Define the classes for the different types of statements
class InputStmt:
    def __init__(self, identifier):
        self.identifier = identifier

class OutputStmt:
    def __init__(self, identifier):
        self.identifier = identifier

class AssignmentStmt:
    def __init__(self, identifier, expression):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.expression = expression

class ConditionalStmt:
    def __init__(self, identifier, expression1, expression2, expression3):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.expression1 = expression1
        self.expression2 = expression2
        self.expression3 = expression3

# Call the parser to generate a parse tree
parse_tree = program()
In this example, the parse_expression() function is left as TODO, as it would need to implement the logic for parsing expressions according to the grammar rules. Once the parse tree is generated, it can be used for further processing, such as semantic analysis and code generation.
